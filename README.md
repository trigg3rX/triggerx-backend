## Core Components

### Task Manager

The **Task Manager** serves as the backbone for decentralized job scheduling and execution. It:
- Automates task scheduling and optimizes resource usage.
- Uses a dynamic quorum system for fault tolerance.
- Monitors progress and persists results.
- Features:
  - Load balancing.
  - State persistence.
  - Support for various execution triggers.
  
### Keepers

The **Keepers** are responsible for executing tasks by:
- Monitoring jobs and validating conditions.
- Interacting with smart contracts securely.
- Processing arguments (static, dynamic, or none).
- Integrating with external data sources for real-time inputs.

Operating in a decentralized architecture, Keepers ensure:
- Fault tolerance.
- Efficient resource usage.
- Secure and reliable contract interactions.

### Validator

The **Validator** ensures the accuracy and integrity of task execution by:
- Validating off-chain tasks.
- Generating cryptographically secure responses.
- Submitting verified results to the blockchain.

Validators maintain system reliability by:
- Ensuring tasks meet predefined criteria.
- Synchronizing off-chain and on-chain states effectively.
